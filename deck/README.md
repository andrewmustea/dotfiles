# deck

Configs I use to set up my Steam Deck environment.

## [`home/`](home/)

Configs that belong in a user's `${HOME}` directory.

### [`home/bash_profile`](home/bash_profile)

Script that's sourced when entering an interactive login bash shell.

> Rename to `.bash_profile` before placing in `${HOME}`.

### [`home/bashrc`](home/bashrc)

Script that's sourced when entering a bash shell.

> Rename to `.bashrc` before pacing in `${HOME}`.
